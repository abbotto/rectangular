# format for examples
- examples must have trailing commas, this allows copy pasting without added work
- when all docs follow a format, changing the format is quite easy since things can be search-and-replaced
- to keep consistency across the docs:
  - import from `fuse-box` is `fsbx`
    - `import fsbx from "fuse-box"`
    - `fsbx.TypeScriptHelpers()`
  - `.FuseBox` from `fsbx` (`fsbx.FuseBox`) is `FuseBox`:
    - `const FuseBox = fsbx.FuseBox`
  - instantiation of `FuseBox` is `fuse`
    - `const fuse = FuseBox.init(config)`
  - use `.init` and not `new` except when explaining the ability to use `new`
  - all objects have no spacing between property and value
    - good: `{port: 8080}`
    - bad  : `{port : 8080}`
    - bad:`{port:8080}`
