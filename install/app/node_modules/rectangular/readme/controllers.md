## Controllers
- Controllers are used in `components` and `directives`.
- Controllers should be used for:
	- Set up the initial state of the 'View Model`.
	- Add behavior to the `View Model`.
- Do not use controllers:
	- For anything other than business logic.
	- To share code or state across controllers â€” Use services instead.
