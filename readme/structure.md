## Structure

### Functional File Structure (FFS)
- Basically, files are organized according to what they are used for and folders are kept as flat as possible.
	- For example, the `home` component is located here: `app/component/home/`.
	- Component-specific directives, models, view, route, and styles are all kept in the same directory.
