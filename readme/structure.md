## Structure

### Files by Functionality (FBF) Structure
- Basically, files are organized according to what they are used for.
	- For example, the demo `excuse` component is located here: `src/client/component/excuse/`.
	- It's directives, models, template, route, controller, and styles are all in the same directory as the view.
	- Now you can save your fingers from years of scrolling hell!
	
### Index Naming Convention
- Never name a file `src/**/index.ext` unless you are evil or it is an actual index for something.
