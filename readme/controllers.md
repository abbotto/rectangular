## Controllers
- Controllers are used for pulling/pushing data to/from services and other means.
	- Controllers should only be used in `view directives`.
		- You can read more about the `no-controller` rule [here](https://github.com/Gillespie59/eslint-plugin-angular/blob/master/docs/no-controller.md).
