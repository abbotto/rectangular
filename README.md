## Overview
Out-of-the-box, `Rectangular` lets you build apps that are:
- Scalable
- Testable
- Organized
- Responsive
- Modular

Essentially, there are 3 parts to `Rectangular`:
- the `Installer`
- the `Application Kit`
- the `Build System`.

#### Installer
##### Features
- An `project installer` for initializing the `application kit`.
- An `extension installer` for several popular 3rd-party packages.

#### Application Kit
##### Features
- A built-in `caching system` that retains your environment variables, models, and templates for instant access.
- A built-in `extension system` for integrating 3rd-party vendor plugins and libraries in a jiffy.
- A built-in `karma` + `jasmine` testing suite to help your code pass with flying colors.
- A built-in `asset loader` for easily adding additional styles and scripts.
- A built-in `service loader` that finds and compiles `services` for you.
- A built-in `route loader` that finds and compiles `routes` for you.
- A built-in `eslint` configuration for `ES6` and `AngularJS`.
- A built-in `livereload` server for development.
- A built-in task-runner provided by `gulp`.
- A built-in `semantic versioning` system.

#### Build System
##### Features
- Support for `PUG` syntax so you can write cleaner HTML templates.
- Support for `ES6` syntax so you can write modernized JavaScript.
- Support for `SASS` for awesome stylesheets.
- Support for `autoprefixer` so your styles work on as many browsers as possible.
- Support for `stylelint` to make sure your styles come out clean.
