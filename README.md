## Overview
Out-of-the-box, `Rectangular` lets you build apps that are:
- Scalable
- Testable
- Organized
- Responsive
- Modular

There are 2 main parts to `Rectangular`, the `Application Kit` and the `Build System`.

#### Application Kit
##### Features
- A `caching system` that retains your environment variables, models, and templates for instant access.
- A no-nonsense `extension system` for integrating 3rd-party vendor plugins and libraries in a jiffy.
- A built-in `asset loader` for easily adding additional styles and scripts.
- Pre-configured `eslint` rules for `ES6` and `AngularJS`.
- Pre-configured `karma` + `jasmine` testing suite.
- A built-in `semantic versioning` system.
- A `livereload` server for development.
- Support for the `gulp` task-runner.

#### Build System
##### Features
- An `project installer` for initializing the application kit.
- An `extension installer` for several popular 3rd-party packages.
- An `app compiler` that finds and compiles required files for you.
- Support for `ES6` syntax so you can write your JavaScript in style.
- Support for `PUG` syntax so you can write cleaner HTML templates.
- `Testing utilities` to help your code pass with flying colors.
